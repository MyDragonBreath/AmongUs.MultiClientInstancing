# Debugger for MCI

We added a debugger to MCI. This Debugger is just an adaptation of the Reworked Debugger of Alcoholic Dev so it can work with any mod. It has some new functions and some functions of the original Reworked Debugger. Thanks to whichtwix for helping me a lot to make this debugger.

Note: I am not a creator of MCI or something else. I just maid an "addon" for this mod. Please check the official repository at https://github.com/MyDragonBreath/AmongUs.MultiClientInstancing/.
