# AmongUs.MultiClientInstancing

I think the best way to describe this is as a method of host testing what your "mod" could look like with multiple clients.
It is in no way a replacement for testing your mod and has a complete disregard for rpc calls.
It can also be buggy with different mods differently depending on how they interact with amongus - so chances are its not going to be perfect.
Think of this as more like a ease-of-access utility then a standlone testing environment.

Whilst in lobby press f5 to add players,
press f6 to toggle between keeping or losing bots between games,
and in game press f9 to move up or f10 to move down through the id list.
You can press f11 to remove all bots.

You can press shift + f6 to switch between IKnowWhatI'm Doing Mode.

i've left it openended for any future features but i dont think i can see myself regularly maintaning this beyond bug fixes,
but your welcome to pr and contribute

The mod is not designed to be the end all for testing - so expect some things not to work - please read the source to understand how this works.

(note this is older footage as i've now got a system in place to remove the extra buttons from tou)
