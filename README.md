# AmongUs.MultiClientInstancing

I think the best way to describe this is as a method of host testing what your "mod" could look like with multiple clients.<br>
It is in no way a replacement for testing your mod and has a complete disregard for rpc calls.<br>
It can also be buggy with different mods differently depending on how they interact with amongus - so chances are its not going to be perfect.<br>
Think of this as more like a ease-of-access utility then a standlone testing environment.

## Important
Please pr and contribute where you feel is necessary.<br>
The mod is not designed to be the end all for testing - so expect some things, mostly rpc's, not to work - please read the source to understand how this works.<br>
Relies on Bepinex

## Controls 

Whilst in lobby press `F5` to add players,<br>
press `F6` to toggle between keeping or losing bots between games,<br>
and in game press `F9` to move up or `F10` to move down through the id list.<br>
You can press `F11` to remove all bots.<br>
You can press `Shift` + `F6` to switch between IKnowWhatI'm Doing Mode.

(note this is older footage as i've now got a system in place to remove the extra buttons from tou, and names are simplified)
